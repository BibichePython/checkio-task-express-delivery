    On the island our Robots have found the mysterious Boxes. After some examination Nicola have discover the
    interesting
    feature of these Boxes. If you place something in any of the Boxes, then you can take it from any Box.
    Stephan wants to use this property for delivery of cargo across of the island.
    He moves without loads twice faster than without it.
    So Stephan can place the cargo while going to delivery point and take it later in other box.
</p>

<p>
    The map for delivery is presented as an array of strings, where:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        "W" is a wall
    </li>
    <li>
        "B" is a box
    </li>
    <li>
        "E" is an goal point.
    </li>
    <li>
        "S" is a start point.
    </li>
    <li>
        "." is an empty cell.
    </li>

</ul>
<p>
    Stephan move between neighbours cell in two minutes if he is loaded. Without it -- in one minute.
    Loading and unloading of cargo in (out) the box takes one minute.
    You should find the fastest way for cargo delivery (minimum time).
</p>
<p>
    The route is a string, where each letter is an action.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        "U" -- Up (north)
    </li>
    <li>
        "D" -- Down (south)
    </li>
    <li>
        "L" -- Left (west)
    </li>
    <li>
        "R" -- Right (east)
    </li>
    <li>
        "B" -- Load or unload in (out) a box.
    </li>

</ul>
